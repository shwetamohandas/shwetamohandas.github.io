I am a lawyer observing and researching on Intellectual Property Rights and access, Emerging Technologies and their human rights implications, the relevance of data protection and privacy in today's world of datafication. Currently I am working at the Centre for Internet and Society where, I work on Privacy, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and the emerging landscape of Voice Interfaces. Prior to my work at CIS I was a Research Associate to the (DIPP) Intellectual Property Rights Chair at IIT Madras, working on Standard Essential Patents, public funded research, and conducting an empirical analysis of the decisions of various high courts and IP tribunals.I also worked as a project associate for a project undertaking a Systematic Review of Non-State Justice Systems in India.I have an LLM in Public International Law with a special focus on International Human Rights Law, Cyberspace Law and Climate Change Law and Policy, and a LLB from the University of Calcutta.

This site is still very much a work in progress, but it will soon have all the things youâ€™d expect: a little more info, links to my writing and research, some videos of my talks, some press and option pieces, book reviews, and maybe some amateur digital art.
