I am a lawyer observing and researching the legal, regulatory, and societal implications of emerging technologies. Currently my work at the [Centre for Internet and Society(CIS)](https://cis-india.org/) is focussed on the privacy implications of these technologies, and on highlighting the need for better data protection and privacy legislations.I was also fortunate to be a partner with [Tactical Technology](https://tacticaltech.org/) to create [Your Phone Number is Not Only Yours](https://www.theglassroom.org/en/exhibits/your-phone-number-is-not-only-yours/), a Glass Room exhibit.

In my previous work as a Research Associate to the  [Ministry of Commerce & Industry IPR Chair](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5KtCeD3RgKhcTl1T2FpMW1Cc0k/view?resourcekey=0-JS6FfiJ8zUkT02e1xv5D4w),where I researched on patent litigation in the arena of mobile phone technology, licensing of public funded research and empirical analysis of the decisions of various high courts and IP tribunals in India. I also had the opportunity to work as a research assistant on a  project undertaking a [Systematic Review of Non-State Justice Systems in India](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5b0fe39d40f0b634c24e6190/NSJ-Final-Sept04_report.pdf).

I have an LLM in Public International Law from Queen Mary University of London and an  LLB from the University of Calcutta.
